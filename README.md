## 🧪 Lab Topics Covered

Each `.pkt` file explores a unique area of computer networks:

- ✅ Basic Networking & Device Configuration  
- ✅ IP Addressing & Subnetting  
- ✅ Static Routing  
- ✅ Dynamic Routing (RIP, OSPF)  
- ✅ VLAN & Inter-VLAN Routing  
- ✅ DHCP Configuration  
- ✅ DNS & Web Access Simulation  
- ✅ Final Network Design & Troubleshooting
